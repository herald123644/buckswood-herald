        <!-- Article Paragraphs -->
        <p>
            I can’t believe anything like this could happen — thought Dr. McClean, thinking about his former clients, the Hadley family, whose demise became their own children who had become corrupted by the technological advancements of this world.

        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. McClean, a psychologist Specializing in treating people affected by over-reliance on technology, shocked and even terrified by what the world has come to. He’s walking through the streets of Neottera, stretched endlessly into the horizon, cold, Empty, quiet but filled with the abiding hum of automated cleaners. Buildings like monoliths, tall and smooth, illuminated by a constant glow from digital screens seen through every window. Above, the sky was a dull grey, no stars, no moon. Everything lifeless, oppressive.

        </p>

        <p>
            The city was like a heart stilled, beatless, a phone with no battery, Dead and the only thing breathing, with a beating heart and a conscious brain, Mr. Mead, walking, strolling, sauntering every single day as a way of keeping himself from losing what made him human — thought, individual thought.

        </p>

        <p>
            Walking, Both walking, both for the same reason, same problem, forward, and only forward, towards each other, Drawn together like magnets, their bodies mirrored each other, though their inner worlds were as opposite as north and south.
        </p>

        <p>
            — Huh, that cleaning machine looks awfully tall. Well, I guess they’re making them look like humans. — Mr. Mead whispered to himself.

        </p>
        <p>
            As he went further he couldn’t help but think it was another human.


        </p>

        <p>
            — No, No way, Thats not…. No, It is, ITS IS, or …. Are my eyes lying to me again, or … is it the police, No, No, YES, YES, ITS A PERSON, WALKING. — his heart racing, but then… the excitement stops, He doesn’t understand, why, is he walking, he never thought he would be scared to see another person walk. But he is, he is terrified.


        </p>

        <p>
            As soon as they got closer, they stooped, they stopped walking.

        </p>

        <p>
            For a moment they both stood in silence, not uttering a word. Standing, staring into each other’s eyes, like theres a world beyond, just like theirs.


        </p>
        <p>
            — You’re walking… too? — Mr. Mead said, cautiously.


        </p>

        <p>
            — I didn’t think anyone else still did.


        </p>

        <p>
            — Neither did I… — He thought, he found a person just like him, someone who still resisted, who still remembered what it meant to live. — why do, you walk?

        </p>

        <p>
            — I walk to observe… to understand how people like you still cling to the past.


        </p>
        <p>
            — What do you mean, you walk but not to keep you humanness, but to observe?!

        </p>

        <p>
            — yes, I’m a phycologist, I’m meant to observe, My job is help people stop being so dependent on technology, to help them control the time, spent.



        </p>

        <p>
            — control? What control? People have become so hypnotised they don’t even go outside? They have forgotter how to live, and you want to help them?! You have to stop them, IS YOU’RE HERE TO HELP PEOPLE, HELP THEM BY TAKING AWAY THE TECHNOLOGY ALL-TOGETHER!


        </p>

        <p>
            — That’s not how it works. You can’t just take it all away. People need to learn balance, not have everything ripped from them. It’s about guiding them, not controlling them.

        </p>
        <p>
            — Guiding them? They’re too far gone for balance! You’re just letting them drown while pretending to help. The only real help is to end this madness, to make them face life again!

        </p>

        <p>
            — If we just take the technology, how will they live? As you said, they have forgotten how to live on their own. Whose to say the world wont fall into chaos?


        </p>

        <p>
            — You’re insane, how can you walk, see whats going on, and not want to change everything, not want to END IT ALL?!

        </p>

        <p>
            — again, Im a phycologist, Im supposed to help them, do it on their own, understand how to, not do it for them and cause chaos in their life.


        </p>
        <p>
            Mr. Mead was furious — how could he have thought anyone was like him? How could Dr. McClean have a plan that refused to confront the real problem, in the world that needed drastic change?



        </p>

        <p>
            His furiousness grows into frustration. How could he think, Dr. McClean could understand him.



        </p>

        <p>
            — People need moderation. It would be like cutting their life support cord, society will crumble without any technology. The doctor, tried explaining calmly, seeing Mr. meads frustration.


        </p>

        <p>
            Every single word Mr. Mead hears, makes it even harder for him to think anything but, how a man who’s supposed to be helping, is refusing to take real action, he feels trapped, trapped in his thoughts, nit uttering a single word.



        </p>
        <p>
            — humanity as we know it, isn’t ready for drastic change overnight, we cant rush into things like this, the outcome could be disastrous.



        </p>

        <p>
            And then, there they were, Words bursting out, like a flock of birds stuck in a cage for what had felt like forever.



        </p>

        <p>
            — There no time! Everyones lost in TV screens, They have forgotten the green trees, the green grass, the blue sky with clouds, the breeze they felt in the afternoon, They have forgiven life! Whose going to actually help, if you’re here saying the only way to help is to let things happen on their own!


        </p>

        <p>
            — Thats not…

        </p>
        <p>
            As he was about to explain his side again, Dr. McClean felt the touch and grab of the cold, tough like stone hands of Mr. Mead around his neck. The doctors eyes widened in shock. Pressing onto his carotid artery’s, pressing with all his might, hands shaking. Dr. McCleans body weekend as the blood flow got restricted to his brain, these were his final moments, final moments he couldn’t understand. His skin turned pale, eyes began to glaze over, he stoped resisting, he couldn’t resist anymore , He. Just. Couldn’t.


        </p>

        <p>
            Mr. Mead held on, he couldn’t let his hands go, like he couldn’t control them…



        </p>

        <p>
            The doctors body fell onto the concrete floor, now as lifeless as the streets, as dull as life in Neottera.

        </p>

        <p>
            Mr. Mead left standing, over Dr. McClean’s body. A moment, No, the constant of silence as he comprehends his actions. He just killed a man, not only because of their philosophical differences but because he feels trapped in a world he can’t change.

        </p>
        <p>
            He looks around the empty streets, realizing that his action, while drastic, might not make any difference in this cold, technocratic world.

        </p>

        <p>
            He starts to run, faster and faster, further and further away. He feels his legs burn, feels his breath become desperate gasps. He’s not walking to keep himself together anymore — he’s running, running to escape what he has become.
